    "text": "Transcript — Video 2 (Measurement Scales)\nSo once you have an idea of what data is in our dataset, how it’s tract, it’s good to take a look at those variables and think, Okay, how is this data is actually stored? Either How was it coded? How is it stored numerically? Is that gonna be useful for us? Is it going to be, is it going to tell us the information that we need? Or do we need to go look at data from a different source?\nSo textbook definition of how data is measured is as follows. As follows. Here, we talked a little bit about those categorical variables. There’s numeric variables. But this type of data and how it’s stored. It is also important to know what’s the scale that the date is on. So textbook definition, we have nominal ordinal, interval and ratio scale data. And this is getting into, once we have this data, numerically, what we do with it mathematically.\nNominal scale is the lowest level. This is a naming type verbal, so the categories that we have are just there for naming purposes just to keep track of. Okay. This person isn’t, this, isn’t this category or not. It’s usually a categorical type scale.\nOrdinal scale is the same sort of thing. We looked at this a little bit with categorical scales where there’s some order inherent to the, to the way the data is tracked.\n(… transcript continues …)"

Is it in a format that’s gonna be, it’s gonna be useful for analysis. Or do we need to do some additional work in that transform space where we’re getting that data set up and organized just how we want it.\nFirst thing to think about is, how is this, these variables, this data is measuring. How is that data being stored or represented in our spreadsheet or in the database that we’re looking at. It’s usually going to break into two main categories. Categories as a category here. So this would be if our data has discrete things that it’s measuring.\nSimple example would be like a true‑false variable. Does this person live on‑campus true or false? It’s going to be a one or a zero. Logical yes or no, sort of a thing.\n(… transcript continues …)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Transcript — Video 1 (ETL)\nIt’s usually one of our first task is figuring out how to get the data where we need it to be in order to use it and do our analysis on it. So generally when we’re getting data, it’s going to follow this type of a process, extract, transform load or ETL process. A lot of the data that we’re gonna be working with, especially for this course, is going to be data that other people have gathered what’s known as secondary data. Later on in the class, we will talk little bit about primary data, how to, how to gather data for a specific purpose. But the vast majority of the time we’re gonna be using data that’s already existing and whether it is from a third party source or internally within our company has sales database or something like that. We usually don’t have a lot of say in how their data is structured, how it’s set up. So we need to figure out how to get that data in the form that it’s in currently. And then get it into a form that we’re gonna be able to do. Our nails the sun.\nThe first step in that process is to extract the data. And that is to get the data from wherever it is to our computer, to where we’re gonna be working with it at. That data can take on a number of different forms. Sometimes the data is relatively clean. If it is a something like this where we have a structured database where everything is set up just so you know, each point of data is in its own row, each specific variables in its own column. So sometimes it might be pretty much in the form that we need to use it, right where it is.\nOther times you might be grabbing it from a website or something like that. If you wanted to do some analysis looking at census data, you will go to the Census Bureau’s website and download data from there. It might just be unstructured data just pouring into, into a database, some sort of a sensor or something that is tracking data, looking at a motion sensor or something like that. Where, you know, every time that that sensor is triggered, it it changes from a truth or false yes or no sort of a thing. Measuring the brightness or measuring the voltage of a certain sensor. Measuring whether or not motion was detected on a video camera. That data might just be constantly pouring in. And then we have to figure out, okay, how we’re gonna deal with this L. We’re going to figure out what the timestamp was. What does this data, what is it telling us?\nThat first step is to is to extract that data. So get it out of where it is right now. Get it to where we need it to be. Once we have that data downloaded or transferred over to where we’re gonna be using it or connected to, you know, sometimes we don’t actually need the data, we just make a connection to where it’s at. Next step is to transform that data to get it into a format that’s going to be convenient for us to use that we can do analysis on without a constantly having to go in and edit things and change things and recalculate. So that’s the T part of the ETL process transform to get the data from the form that it’s in when we get it, to change it to the form that we’re gonna be using it for our analysis.\nSo a lot of times we’re editing this data, so it’s gonna be stored in a consistent way. It’s gonna be efficient for us to go and look at it. There’s certain rules that we’re going to follow that’s gonna make our lives much easier when it comes time to analyze that data or build a chart or do some analysis on it. There are some standard ways to keep that where any tool that we’re going to connect to that data width is going to be able to look at it in a similar way.\nThe example on the top here, that a good before if we download data from the Census Bureau, It’s gonna look something like this. So this data is stored in a way where we have gigabytes of data on. However many million people live in the country. All that data is stored on a server somewhere in a way that’s going to be convenient for the Census Bureau. That’s not necessarily convenient for us. You can see we have a lot of empty space here. If category one, category to category three, you might not know what those things mean.\nA lot of times we need to transform that data to get it into something. It’s going to be a little bit more convenient for us to use consistent way to measure what was the time that his data was recorded? Consistent way to measure geographically, what was their zip code? What was the date of what was what were the different categories that it falls into? A lot of times we can store that in a much more efficient way. We do it as part of the transform process.\nLast step then is to load it into the program that we’re gonna be using to do our analysis. In this can be anything. Sometimes we go from a database, we transform it and put it right back into that same database. This doesn’t necessarily have to be different programs that we’re using.\n(… transcript continues …)"

    "text": "Grading\n\nCalculations\nYour overall grade consists of the following assessments, arranged by type and value. Your final grade can be computed by multiplying the scores received by the percentages reported below to arrive at a weighted average. Team assignments are denoted by (T) but please note grades received for team project deliverables will be adjusted by your Peer Evaluation score.\n\n\n\n\nAssignment\n\n\n#\n\n\nTotal % Final Grade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomework, Lab Prep & In Class Labs\n\n\n~10\n\n\n20%\n\n\n\n\nQuizzes\n\n\n~5\n\n\n20%\n\n\n\n\nFinal Exam & Practicum\n\n\n1\n\n\n20%\n\n\n\n\nCase Projects (T)\n\n\n2\n\n\n30%\n\n\n\n\nParticipation / Discussion\n\n\n\n\n10%\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n100%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculation of individual grades for team project work\nAll work for the assignments denoted as Team Projects by (T) above will be scored out of 100 points to assign a Team Grade. Individual grades will be computed by multiplying the Team Grade by the CATME peer evaluation score you receive for that work. The CATME peer evaluation is a psychometrically validated and behaviorally anchored rating scale developed under a National Science Foundation Grant and used by universities throughout the country. Through a secure web-based platform, you will rate your own and your teammate’s performance on each project. This information will be reported in the aggregate to your teammates (they cannot see who gave them what scores) and will produce a Peer Evaluation Score. Most students receive a score of 1, those that exhibit exceptional performance receive scores above 1 with a maximum of 1.05. Underperforming teammates receive scores below 1, and as low as 0.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote: This is not a “zero sum game”. It is possible for team members to get scores above 1 without others getting scores below. The algorithm flags evaluations that appear to manipulate ratings to inflate their own scores. Your score will automatically be reduced by 0.05 if you fail to complete the Peer Evaluation on or before the due date.\n\n\n\n\nGrievance procedure for peer evaluation scores\nPoor peer evaluations can lead an individual grade to fall substantially below the Team Grade. For example, a project that received a score of 95/100 would produce an individual grade of 38/100 if you receive a peer evaluation score of 0.4. If you feel the score you received does not accurately reflect your contributions to Team Project work, you have the option to file a grievance. To do so you must follow this procedure:\n\nWithin 2 business days of the official notification that grades have been posted, communicate to your instructor via email your intent to file a grievance. Official notifications of grade posting will appear on Canvas notifications.\nWithin 1 business day of notifying your intent, prepare and email a one page formal letter addressed to your teammates and including the following information:\n\nYour understanding of the work you had agreed to do for the deliverable. Be sure to refer to any documentation that is relevant (Meeting Minutes, emails or group chats, revision histories in documents etc.). Be prepared to provide any documentation you mention in the letter if requested.\nA summary of the work you actually did. Refer to documentation as above.\nJustification for any discrepancies between (a) and (b). If this documentation includes any confidential health or personal matters you do not wish to disclose to your team, please raise this with me or contact Student Life Office for council. Note: In these cases it is best to reach out to me or Student Life before you are at the point of receiving a bad peer evaluation.\nA statement of the peer evaluation score you believe you have earned.\n\nIf after reviewing your letter I believe the case has merit, I will send it on to your teammates and schedule an arbitration. If I determine no arbitration is warranted, I will schedule a one-on-one meeting with you to discuss.\nIf arbitration is warranted, it must be conducted in-person with all team members present. The only exception to this requirement would be a case where the timeline in the procedure would place the earliest possible arbitration date after the final exam date. In those cases, a virtual meeting may be agreed upon or incomplete grades may be assigned until an in-person meeting can be scheduled. I will serve as the arbitrator. You and your teammates will have the opportunity to present your case and reconcile evidence referenced in your letter. At the end of the meeting, all team members (including yourself) will submit the score they believe you have earned to me via secret ballot. I will use this information in making my final determination, but the final determination is mine alone.\n\n\n\nLate assignments, missed quizzes\n\nIndividual assignments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIndividual assignments are due on the dates indicated on the Canvas Weekly Agendas. Late or missing assignments will not be graded. All assignments in a module must be completed before the Module Quiz. If extenuating circumstances impact your ability to meet deadlines or participate in class activities, you are responsible for alerting me as soon as possible. When conflicts are known ahead of the deadline you must notify me ahead of the deadline. All communication regarding missed or late individual work should be confirmed by email – even if we speak in person or during student hours, you must follow up via email to confirm so that we both have a record of the agreement.\n\n\n\n\nTeam assignments\nDeadlines for Team Assignments may be extended for the entire class if there are extenuating circumstances or granted to teams if requested with appropriate justification and all team members agree to the request. Presentations cannot be delayed unless there is a major emergency or complication. For other deliverables, extensions must be requested at least 1 business day before the due date. Be prepared to show appropriate documentation of work to date and to provide an explanation for the value you will add to the final product if the extension is granted. Unless a request is made and granted, late assignments will receive a grade of 0.\n\n\nMissed quizzes\nQuizzes may be rescheduled only in the case of serious illness, injury, or significant academic or professional development opportunity. Personal travel or family vacations will not be accommodated unless they are associated with a significant life event (birth, death, marriage, graduation). In all cases, documentation is required. Contact me via email as soon as you know you have a conflict. Local or phone/Skype job interviews are not considered significant professional development opportunities.\n\n\n\nAttendance and participation\nAlthough attendance will not be formally recorded for all class meetings, your Team can and should reduce your peer evaluation score if you miss meetings or are absent during in class Work Days. To avoid this consequence, you should:\n\nCommunicate clearly with your team any time you will be absent from a Team Meeting or class on a day that includes Case Work Time.\n\nDocument that communication (e.g. save emails or post to team message board).\n\nParticipate actively in scheduling Team Meetings outside of class.\n\nLay out policies on scheduling team meetings and missed meetings and follow them.\n\nRespect others’ time and reserve absences for only when absolutely unavoidable.\n\nCommunicate with me (your instructor) or the Office of Student Life if any situation arises that will dramatically impact your attendance in class and at team meetings (e.g. serious illness, injury or personal emergency).\n\nIf you are absent from class, it is your responsibility to obtain notes and other materials from colleagues. While you are welcome to book student hours, you should not view them as a substitute for coming to class. If you are absent regularly without a documented extenuating circumstance, requests for student hours meetings may be denied.\n\n\nExpectations for graded work\n\nIndividual assignments\nI provide students feedback and/or scores on assignments that require individualized grading before a further assignment of a similar format is due or within 21 days of submission, whichever is shorter. This includes quizzes. I will notify you if I am unable to complete grading within the 21-day timeframe, and will identify a revised return date. If you submit work after the due date, it may not be returned within 21 days, and depending on the justification for late submission, it may not be accepted at all. Your graded coursework will be returned in compliance with FERPA regulations, such as in class, during my student hours, or via the course management system through which only you will have access to your grades.\n\n\n\nGrading scale\n\n\n\n\nLetter Grade\n\n\nPercentage Equivalent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n93-100%\n\n\n\n\nAB\n\n\n89-92%\n\n\n\n\nB\n\n\n83-88%\n\n\n\n\nBC\n\n\n79-82%\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n70-78%\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n60-69%\n\n\n\n\nF\n\n\n59% - below"
