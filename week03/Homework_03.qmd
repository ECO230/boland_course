::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="false" title="Purpose"}
This assignment practices the Week 3 goal:

> **Choose a visualization that matches the analytical frame** (the kind of comparison you want the audience to make) **and apply perception‑aware design.**

You will produce **three small visuals** (from three different frames) and **brief written justifications** that explain:

- the *story* you are trying to tell,
- *why* this chart type is the right encoding for that story, and
- *which* design principles you intentionally applied.
:::

## Objectives

- Map a **data story** to the correct **analytical frame** and chart form
- Apply **perceptual design** choices from lecture (lines, area, color, clutter)
- Communicate with **succinct captions**, clear scales, and explicit denominators

## Resources

- **Week 3 slides** (visual perception; analytical frames)
- Week 1–2 slides (grain, NOIR, size/center/shape/relationships)
- Your **Week 1-2 dataset** (or any approved course dataset)
- Tools: **Excel and/or Tableau** (you may mix; no code required)

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal" icon="false" title="Important"}
- Your grade emphasizes **fit‑for‑purpose** encodings + **clean design**.
- Include a short **brief writeup (3–5 sentences)** for each chart.
- A **Design Checklist** is **encouraged** for each chart (not required).

## 1) Choose Your Dataset (Week 1)

1. Use one of the four Week 1 datasets (you may keep the same as HW1 & HW2 or change to a different dataset).
2. Note any filters/cleaning (e.g., date window, excluding blanks).

*(No extended writeup—just list what you did.)*

---

## 2) Tools (Excel/Tableau)

- Build visuals in **Excel** and/or **Tableau** (mixing is fine).
- Export images (PNG) at reasonable resolution for pasting into your document.
- You may build visuals in **posit.cloud** if you choose, but that is hard mode.

---

## 3) Three Visuals — One From **Each** Module Below

Produce exactly **three** visuals, selecting **one** from **each** module (A, B, C). Avoid repeating the same frame.

### **A. Comparison (pick one)**
- **Nominal comparison** (e.g., side‑by‑side bars) *or*
- **Ranking** (sorted bars; horizontal recommended)

**Design tips:** labeled axes, clear units, sorted categories when ranking.


### **B. Composition or Difference (pick one)**
- **Part‑to‑Whole** → Percentages as a bar graph *or*
- **Time series** of a single metric (line, honest scale) *or*
- **Deviation** vs a **benchmark** (bars around zero; clearly label/explain the benchmark)

**Design tips:** Part to Whole needs to add to 100%, add a zero baseline for deviation, and annotate the benchmark.


### **C. Distribution or Relationship (pick one)**
- **Frequency distribution** (histogram with sensible binning; or boxplot) *or*
- **Correlation** (scatter; add a simple regression line if appropriate)

**Design tips:** show units, avoid overplotting marks(alpha if dense), call out outliers

---

## 4) Brief Writeup Under Each Visual (3–5 sentences)

Provide a tight paragraph for each image that includes:

1. **Story:** What story are you trying to tell?
2. **Frame & Encoding:** Which analytical frame (e.g., *part‑to‑whole*) and which chart type did you choose—and *why is it a fit* for this story?
3. **Data Scope:** Groupings/filters used; any important denominators or eligibility rules.
4. **Design Principles Applied:** Name at least **two** (e.g., reduced non‑data‑ink; minimal axes; ordered categories; purposeful color; 100% normalization; honest baselines; avoided 3D; judicious regression line).

---

## 5) Design Checklist (Encouraged)

- [ ] Chart type matches the **analytical frame**
- [ ] Axes and units labeled; baselines honest; scales legible
- [ ] Appropriate **ordering** (e.g., sorted bars for ranking)
- [ ] Color used sparingly (subtle default; vivid only when meaningful)
- [ ] **No 3D** or distortions; avoid unnecessary decoration
- [ ] For composition: **100%** normalization, periods sum to 100%
- [ ] For deviation: benchmark labeled; zero line shown
- [ ] For correlation: considered trend line; noted limitations

*(You are encouraged to follow these checks for each chart; not required to paste the list under every visual.)*

---

## 6) Summary (≤ 200 words)

Write a concise summary that synthesizes what your three visuals reveal. Address whether the story aligns with expectations or surfaces something unexpected.

---

## 7) Submission

Upload to Canvas:

1. A **Word or PDF** document that includes:
   - Your **three visuals** (A, B, C) and their **brief writeups** (3–5 sentences each)
   - Your **Summary** (≤ 200 words)
2. Supporting files as applicable:
   - Excel: `.xlsx`
   - Tableau: `.twbx`

---

## 8) Grading Focus (What I'm Look For)

- **Fit‑for‑purpose** chart selection given the story & frame
- **Perceptual clarity**: clean baselines, readable scales, sensible color
- **Sound communication**: succinct captions, explicit denominators/assumptions
- **Overall quality**: coherence across the three stories
