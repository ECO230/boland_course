*Please see page 10 for other important dates.*

##### **Course Description**

Building on the foundation in statistics acquired in STAT 145, students will continue to develop and will
apply skills in data analysis to aid in business decision making. These skills include data collection, data
summarization, data visualization, statistical inference, and communication of data in business contexts.
Students will learn and apply best practices for research design and analysis to address authentic
business cases. Students will build these skills in collaboration with each other and through engagement
with business and community leaders. The course also discusses effective survey design and current
privacy and ethical issues in collecting and using data. Prerequisite: ENG 110 or ENG 112; STAT 145; CBA
major, CASSH economics major, or healthcare analytics management minor. Offered Fall, Spring.

##### **Prerequisites**

Prerequisite: ENG 110 or ENG 112; STAT 145; CBA major, CLS economics major, or Healthcare Analytics
Management Minor.

##### **Office Hours Policy**

In addition to teaching this section, I have a 9-5 job making my availability on campus outside of class
very limited. Most classes have some time built in for group or individual work, take advantage of this
time. If you need to meet face to face during office hours, please let me know. I do have some flexibility
in my schedule and can usually schedule something within a few days given adequate notice.
Learning Outcomes

##### **Learning Outcomes**

###### **Mapped to CBA Undergraduate Curriculum Goals and Objectives**

1. Develop the ability to articulate a business problem or opportunity using qualitative and
quantitative evidence and propose an analysis plan to identify potential solutions, including
collection of primary data via surveys. (CT-1)

2. Describe, summarize, and interpret data using descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, and
data visualization.

3. Develop foundational skills related to spreadsheets, interactive data visualization software, and
scripting languages used for data analysis and visualization.

4. Communicate the purpose, methods, and results of analysis to authentic audiences in
appropriate written and oral formats. (CS-1, CS-2)

5. Apply research design and data analysis best practices to complete case-based projects and to
critique others’ analyses. (CT-1)

6. Describe current debates in research ethics and data privacy and the implications for business
research. (SR-1)

##### **CBA Undergraduate Curriculum Goals and Objectives referenced above:**

* Communication Goal: Our students will be able to convey information and ideas effectively.
  * (CS-1) Learning Objective: Students will convey information and ideas in professional
business reports
  * (CS-2) Learning Objective: Students will convey information and ideas in oral
presentations.
* Decision Making and Critical Thinking Goal: Our students will be able to think critically when
evaluating decisions.
  * (CT-1) Learning Objective: Students will evaluate alternatives and understand the
ramifications of those alternatives within a given business context.
* Social Responsibility Goal: Students will demonstrate the role of social responsibility in business
decisions.
  * (SR-1) Learning Objective: Students will be able to identify and apply different
frameworks of social responsibility to business problems and recognize the short- and
long-term effects on stakeholders and society.

##### **Materials & Tools**

There is no official textbook for this course. All readings will be provided electronically via Canvas.
We will also use the following software and instructional tools which are free of charge to you due to
your enrollment in this course. Instructions for use will be provided in class and on Canvas as needed.

* **Excel**
* **Tableau Desktop**
* **Posit Cloud**
* Qualtrics
* CATME

##### **Format**

This is a face-to-face course. You may be asked to reference materials or participate online through the
learning management system, Canvas. If that is the case, you will need your UWL NetID to login to the
course from the Canvas homepage http://www.uwlax.edu/canvas.

##### **Calculations**

Your overall grade consists of the following assessments, arranged by type and value. Your final grade
can be computed by multiplying the scores received by the percentages reported below to arrive at a
weighted average. Team assignments are denoted by (T) but please note grades received for team
project deliverables will be adjusted by your Peer Evaluation score.

* **Design an experiment that can be used to test a cause/effect relationship between two variables.**

* What is the Independent Variable?:

* What is the Dependent Variable?: 

* Describe your experimental design. How will you measure subjects before and after treatment, what will your experimental and control groups look like?:

* How will you control for extraneous and confounding variables?  How will you manage demand characteristics?: 


<div class="alert alert-secondary">
  <strong>Instructions: Machine Learning Model Design</strong>
</div>

* **Outline a Machine Learning Model that can do somethign useful (or stupid if you choose).**

* What would you like your model to be able to do? Is it a classification model or will it be used to cluster data into groups?:

* What types of features (input variables) do you think will be important for the model. How will data be labelled?:

* Are there any existing models that do something similar? Can you find any information on how they were trained or what type of model they use?:
