::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="false" title="Purpose"}
This assignment builds directly on Week 1’s data-anatomy foundations and introduces Week 2’s **five descriptive buckets**:

1.  **Size** (how much data do we have?)\
2.  **Center** (what’s typical?)\
3.  **Spread** (how variable?)\
4.  **Shape** (what form does the distribution take?)\
5.  **Key relationships** (how do variables move together?)

You will practice producing these summaries in **Excel**, **Tableau**, and **posit.cloud (R)**, and reflect on how to use AI responsibly to **accelerate—not replace—your thinking**.
:::

## Objectives

-   Connect to one dataset in **Excel, Tableau, and posit.cloud**
-   Verify variables are **consistent across tools** (types, categories, missingness)
-   Produce descriptive summaries using the Week 2 framework
-   Interpret results with correct **denominators** (especially for percentages)
-   Communicate insights clearly
-   Use AI responsibly for support—not analysis

## Resources

-   Week 2 slides (Descriptive Measures)
-   Your dataset from Posit Cloud (or any file saved from Homework 1)
-   Data description files on Canvas

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal" icon="false" title="Important"}
This assignment is graded for **sincere completion**, not perfection.\
Try every step. Bring questions to class. We will review patterns and common issues together.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1) Choose and Use One Dataset (Across All Tools)

1.  Select **one** dataset from your Posit Cloud project (you may reuse Homework 1’s dataset).\
2.  Use the **same dataset** in **Excel**, **Tableau**, and **posit.cloud (R)**.

*(No written response required.)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2) Data Consistency Check (Across Tools)

Open/preview the dataset in **Excel**, **Tableau**, and **R**.

Write **3–5 sentences** answering:

-   Are the **variable types** consistent across tools? (numeric vs categorical vs date/time)
-   Do categories match exactly (no extra spaces, case differences, or “duplicates”)?
-   Are there missing values or obvious formatting issues?
-   Did any tool auto-convert a variable incorrectly?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3) Bucket 1 — Size (Counts)

Produce a **size** summary in **any one tool**:

-   Total row count (**N**) and (if relevant) a filtered count (**n**)
-   A frequency table for **one categorical** variable

Examples:

-   **Excel:** Pivot table with *Count* in Values
-   **Tableau:** Count of records + a bar chart of category counts
-   **R:** `count(variable)` or `summarise(n = n())`

Write **2–4 sentences** interpreting what the counts reveal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4) Bucket 2 — Center (Mean or Median)

Create a center summary in a **different tool** than you used in Step 3.

Do **one** of the following:

-   Mean of a numeric variable overall
-   Mean **by a category** (group comparison)
-   Median of a numeric variable overall
-   Median **by a category**

Examples:

-   **Excel:** Pivot table with *Average* (or *Median* if available)
-   **Tableau:** Use AVG or MEDIAN aggregation
-   **R:** `summarise(mean = mean(x, na.rm=TRUE))` and/or `median(x, na.rm=TRUE)`

Write **2–4 sentences**:

-   Which center measure (mean vs median) is more appropriate here—and why?
-   What does the “typical value” tell you?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5) Bucket 3 — Spread OR Bucket 4 — Shape (Choose One)

Use the **third tool** (the one you have not used yet) and complete **one** of the following:

### Option A — Spread

Produce at least **one** measure of spread for a numeric variable:

-   Standard deviation (SD)
-   IQR (Interquartile Range)
-   Percentiles (e.g., P10, P50, P90)

### Option B — Shape

Produce at least **one** distribution view:

-   Histogram
-   Boxplot
-   Density plot

Write **2–4 sentences** interpreting variability or shape:

-   Is it skewed?
-   Are there outliers?
-   What does that imply for “typical” values?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6) Bucket 5 — Key Relationships (Required)

Create **one** relationship analysis.

### Option A — Cross-tab (Discrete × Discrete)

Build a cross-tab with:

-   **Counts**
-   At least **one** percentage type: **Row %** *or* **Column %** *or* **Table %**
-   A sentence stating the **denominator** (what the % is “out of”)

### Option B — Scatter + Correlation (Continuous × Continuous)

Create:

-   A scatterplot of two numeric variables
-   A correlation (or trend line) if available

Write **3–5 sentences** describing the relationship:

-   What pattern do you see?
-   What is the denominator (for percentages) or what does the correlation imply?
-   What could mislead someone if they interpret this too quickly?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7) Three Takeaways (Synthesis)

Write **3–5 sentences** summarizing what you learned that you did not know before.

Include **three** takeaways, and for each takeaway:

-   Identify the bucket (size / center / spread / shape / relationships)
-   Reference the evidence (a table/plot you created)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8) Responsible Use of AI (Required)

AI can accelerate learning, but it **must not** interpret results or make analytical decisions for you. Use AI only for clarification, rewriting, or troubleshooting.

Write **5–7 sentences** responding to:

**A.** How did you use AI on this assignment? *(If not at all, state that and why.)*\
**B.** What did AI help with? *(Be specific.)*\
**C.** What did AI get wrong, miss, or oversimplify?\
**D.** Include **one AI prompt you used** and note:

-   How the response helped
-   Where it fell short

Remember our goal with AI:

> “Can you use AI responsibly to **accelerate—not replace—your thinking**?”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9) Submission

Upload to Canvas:

1.  Your **Excel workbook (.xlsx)**
2.  Your **Tableau workbook (.twbx)**
3.  Your posit.cloud work:
    -   `.qmd` (or `.Rmd`) file **and** a rendered **PDF/HTML**
4.  A short document (Word/PDF or Canvas text entry) containing:
    -   Written responses for Steps 2–8
    -   Screenshots/pastes of your tables/plots (unless embedded in your rendered file)

Please bring your files to class for in-class demonstrations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Alignment to Course Outcomes

-   **Choose the right analysis:** You connect measurement scales and variable types to the correct descriptive tools.
-   **Interpret results in context:** You explain denominators and what each summary can/cannot claim.
-   **Explain limitations and uncertainty:** Your consistency check and AI reflection surface constraints before conclusions.
