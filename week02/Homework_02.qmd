::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="false" title="Purpose"}
This assignment helps you practice the Week 2 question:

> **How do we clearly describe the data we have?**

You will build **summary tables only** (no charts yet) to describe:

- **Size** (counts, missingness)
- **Center** (mean or median)
- **Shape** (spread: SD or IQR; optional percentiles)
- **Relationships** (categorical ↔ categorical; continuous ↔ categorical)

You will also reflect briefly on how to use AI responsibly to **accelerate—not replace—your thinking**.
:::

## Objectives

-   Produce clean **summary tables** (no charts)
-   Choose statistics that match the **measurement scale (NOIR)**
-   Keep denominators straight (**N**, *n\_eligible*, *n\_non-missing*)
-   Describe relationships using **group summaries** and **cross-tabs**
-   Communicate results clearly with labels, units, and stated assumptions
-   Reflect on **responsible AI use** in data work

## Resources

-   Week 2 slides (Size, Center, Shape, Relationships; Percentage Problems)
-   Week 1 slides (Unit of Analysis / Grain; Dimensions vs Measures; Tidy Data)
-   Dataset description files on Canvas

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal" icon="false" title="Important"}
This assignment is graded for **clear, careful completion**.

- **No charts** this week.
- Your job is to be explicit and disciplined about **what one row represents**, **what your denominators are**, and **which summaries are meaningful**.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1) Choose Your Dataset (Week 1)

1.  Select **one** of the **four Week 1 datasets**.
2.  You may keep the same dataset from Homework 1 or switch.
3.  In your submission, state:

-   Which dataset you used
-   Any filters or cleaning steps (e.g., removing blanks, focusing on a date range)

*(No written response required beyond the brief notes above.)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2) Tools (You May Mix and Match)

Complete the tables using **Excel**, **Tableau**, **posit.cloud**, or any combination.

-   This does **not** all have to be in one tool.
-   Choose the tool(s) that best support the table you are trying to build.

*(No written response required.)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3) Table 1 — Frequency Table (One Categorical Variable)

Create a frequency table for **one categorical variable** (≥ 3–4 categories recommended).

Your table must include:

-   Category
-   **Count (n)**
-   **Percent of total**
-   Any other information you feel is relevant.

**Goal:** Describe the distribution. What shows up a lot? What is rare?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4) Table 2 — Continuous ↔ Categorical (Choose the Right Summary)

Create a grouped summary table using:

-   **One continuous measure** (a numeric variable where arithmetic is meaningful)
-   **One categorical dimension** (≥ 3 categories)

Your table must include:

-   Group name
-   **n\_non-missing** for the measure
-   A measure of **center** and/or measure of **spread** that matches your choice
-   Any other information you feel is relevant.

Below the table, write **1–2 sentences** explaining why your choices are meaningful.

> **Tables 2–3 are intentionally flexible:** your job is to decide what summary is most meaningful for your variables and explain why.

Hint from Week 2:

-   Mean/SD are most useful when the variable behaves like interval/ratio data with limited outliers.
-   Median/IQR are most useful when data are skewed, have outliers, or when “typical” is better captured by the middle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5) Table 3 — Another Continuous ↔ Categorical Relationship (Different Angle)

Create a second grouped summary table, changing **at least one** of the following:

-   A different continuous measure, **or**
-   A different categorical grouping, **or**
-   A different summary choice (mean/SD vs median/IQR), **or**
-   A different filter or frame (e.g., weekday vs weekend, before vs after a date)

Requirements are the same as Table 2:

-   Group name
-   **n\_non-missing** for the measure
-   A measure of **center** and/or measure of **spread** that matches your choice
-   Any other information you feel is relevant.

**Goal:** Answer a different question than Table 2.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6) Table 4 — Cross-Tab (Categorical ↔ Categorical) + Percentages

Create a cross-tab using **two categorical variables**, each with **≥ 3 categories**.

Your table must include:

-   Cell **counts**
-   **One** percentage type (choose one and label it clearly):

    -   **Row %** (conditional on row)
    -   **Column %** (conditional on column)
    -   **Table %** (overall share)

-   Row and column **totals** (margins)

Below the table, write **one sentence** that states the denominator clearly:

> “These percentages are calculated as ________, so each ______ totals to 100%.”

Remember from Week 2:

> Similar-sounding percentages can answer *different questions*. Make the numerator and denominator explicit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## (Optional) Continuous ↔ Continuous (Correlation Table)

If your dataset includes **two continuous variables that might be related**, you may include **one small correlation table**.

This is **not required**, but it is a strong way to explore whether two measures move together.

If you choose to include it, report:

-   **n\_non-missing** (pairs)
-   Correlation **r**
-   1 sentence interpretation (direction + strength)

*(Still no charts.)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7) Findings Summary (Required)

Write **3 key takeaways** (about 5–10 sentences total).

Each takeaway must:

-   Reference a **specific table** and at least **one number** (value + category)
-   Interpret what it implies (not just restate a statistic)

Strong examples:

-   “Group A has a higher median than Group B (Table 2), suggesting…"
-   “Under row %, Category X is concentrated in Y (Table 4), meaning…"
-   “Mean and median disagree (Table 3), which suggests skew/outliers…"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8) Responsible Use of AI (Brief Reflection — Required)

AI can help you move faster, but it must not make analytical decisions for you.
Use AI only for clarification, rewriting, or troubleshooting.

Write **4–6 sentences** responding to:

**A.** How did you use AI on this assignment? *(If not at all, say so.)*  
**B.** What did AI help with (specific steps)?  
**C.** What did AI miss, oversimplify, or get wrong?  
**D.** Include **one prompt you used** and briefly note how it helped and where it fell short.

Remember our goal:

> “Can you use AI responsibly to **accelerate—not replace—your thinking**?”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9) Submission

Upload to Canvas:

1.  A **PDF or Word** document containing:

    -   Tables 1–4 (and the optional correlation table if included)
    -   Your 3 takeaways
    - Your brief AI reflection

2.  Your supporting files (as applicable):

    -   Excel: `.xlsx`
    -   Tableau: `.twbx`
    -   posit.cloud: knitted output (`.html` or `.pdf`) and your source file

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Alignment to Course Outcomes

-   **Choose the right analysis:** You match summaries to measurement scales (NOIR) and keep denominators explicit.
-   **Interpret results in context:** Your takeaways connect tables to real questions the data can answer.
-   **Explain limitations, assumptions, and uncertainty:** Your justifications and AI reflection surface constraints *before* conclusions.
