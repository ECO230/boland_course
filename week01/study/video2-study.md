## Topic: Measurement Scales & Data Types

---

## Learning Objectives
- Identify each measurement scale (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio).
- Recognize when averages make sense and when they don’t.
- Understand discrete vs. continuous variables.
- Know how variables are coded behind the scenes.

---

## Key Takeaways
- **Nominal** = categories without order (e.g., shirt color, ZIP code).
- **Ordinal** = categories with order (e.g., GPA brackets, class rank).
- **Interval** = numeric scale without a meaningful zero (e.g., Fahrenheit).
- **Ratio** = numeric scale with a real zero (e.g., GPA as a continuous number, height, weight).
- **Discrete** = whole units (e.g., number of people).
- **Continuous** = can take fractional values (e.g., weights, GPAs).
- Averages are meaningful for ratio data; sometimes meaningful for ordinal; rarely meaningful for nominal.
- Computers assign numeric codes to categories, but that doesn’t make them numerical.

## Concept Definitions
### Nominal  
Categorical labels without inherent order.

### Ordinal  
Categories with meaningful ranking, but distances between categories are unknown.

### Interval  
Numeric scale where differences make sense but zero is arbitrary.

### Ratio  
True numeric scale with a real zero; ratios are meaningful.

## Practice Questions

### Multiple Choice
1. Which scale is GPA when recorded exactly (e.g., 3.27)?
   - A) Nominal  
   - B) Ordinal  
   - C) Interval  
   - D) Ratio  
   **Correct answer:** D

2. On which scale does it *not* make sense to compute an average?
   - A) Nominal  
   - B) Ordinal  
   - C) Interval  
   - D) Ratio  
   **Correct answer:** A

3. “Freshman → Sophomore → Junior → Senior” is:
   - A) Nominal  
   - B) Ordinal  
   - C) Interval  
   - D) Ratio  
   **Correct answer:** B

### Short Answer
1. Give an example of why treating nominal data as numeric can be misleading.  
2. Explain why Fahrenheit is an interval scale.  
3. Describe a variable you use in real life and identify its scale.
