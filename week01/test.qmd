# 1) Load data --------------------------------------------------------------

What is **statistics**?
:::

::: fragment
**Analytics** is the **art** of finding out what is in your data.
:::

::: fragment
If you can (with some effort) find the answer with certainty you are using **analytics**.
:::

::: fragment
**Analytics** deals with what you know.

**Statistics** deals with what you do not know.
:::

::: fragment
**Analytics** helps you make good questions.

**Statistics** helps you get good answers.

::: fragment
**Statistics** is the **science** of making decisions under uncertainty.

-   Open with intuition: students already *do* analytics informally.
-   Emphasize uncertainty as the key dividing line.
-   Pause after the third fragment and ask for examples.
