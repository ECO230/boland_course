::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="false" title="Purpose"}
This assignment helps you practice the three essential questions from Week 1:

1.  **What does one row represent?** (unit of analysis / grain)\
2.  **What kinds of variables do I have?** (types + NOIR measurement scales)\
3.  **What can this data actually answer?** (analytical frame)

You will work with real microdata, evaluate its structure, and reflect on how to use AI responsibly to **accelerate—not replace—your thinking**.
:::

## Objectives

-   Open and inspect raw `.csv` data\
-   Save and format data as `.xlsx`\
-   Determine whether a dataset is **tidy**\
-   Contrast **microdata** vs **summary data**\
-   Build a pivot table using **Dimensions** and **Measures**\
-   Describe **unit of analysis** and **grain**\
-   Identify variable types\
-   Reflect on **ethical AI use** in data work

## Resources

-   Datasets in Posit Cloud\
-   Data Description files on Canvas\
-   Week 1 slides (Unit of Analysis, Tidy Data, Dimensions vs Measures)

This assignment is graded for **sincere completion**, not perfection.\
Try every step. Bring questions to class. We will review solutions together.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1) Choose and Download Your Dataset

1.  Select **one** dataset from your Posit Cloud project.\
2.  Download it as a `.csv`.\
3.  Save a working copy as `.xlsx`.

*(No written response required.)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2) Is Your Data Tidy? Why or Why Not?

Using the Week 1 tidy data principles:

-   Each **variable** in its own column\
-   Each **observation** in its own row\
-   One table per **type of observational unit**\
-   Keys required if multiple tables link

**Write 3–5 sentences** answering:

-   Is your dataset tidy? Why or why not?\
-   If it’s not tidy, identify the issue (e.g., wide layout, mixed grains, repeated headers, embedded units).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3) Format as a Table (Excel)

In Excel, convert your data into an official **Table** (`Ctrl/Cmd + T`) to enable consistent filters and references.

*(No written response required.)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4) Build a Pivot Table (Dimensions + Measures)

Create an Excel pivot table using:

-   ≥ **1 Dimension** (categorical descriptor: ZIP, Gender, Date, Location, Category)\
-   ≥ **1 Measure** (numeric summary: Count, Average, Total, Min/Max)

If you encounter errors, **briefly describe what happened** and what you tried.

*(Optional: include a screenshot.)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5) What Is the Unit of Analysis?

In **3–5 sentences**, explain:

-   What **one row represents** in your dataset (the grain)\
-   Why this grain matters for answerable questions\
-   What information would appear if the grain were **more detailed**

Remember your training:

> “Rows are never *just rows*. If you misunderstand the unit of analysis, every result is wrong—even with perfect code.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6) Identify Variable Types

List at least **one** variable for each type.\
If a type is missing, describe the **additional data** you would need.

-   **Categorical (Nominal):**\
-   **Ordinal:**\
-   **True/False (Logical):**\
-   **Discrete Numeric:**\
-   **Continuous Numeric:**\
-   **Date/Time:**\
-   **Geographic/Spatial:**

*(You may list more than one variable for a given type.)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7) Responsible Use of AI (Required)

AI can accelerate learning, but it **must not** interpret results or make analytical decisions for you.\
Use AI only for clarification, rewriting, or troubleshooting.

Write **5–7 sentences** responding to:

**A.** How did you use AI on this assignment?\
*(If not at all, state that and why.)*

**B.** What did AI help with? *(Be specific.)*

**C.** What did AI get wrong, miss, or oversimplify?

**D.** Include **one AI prompt you used** and note:\
- How the response helped\
- Where it fell short

Remember our goal with AI:

> “Can you use AI responsibly to **accelerate—not replace—your thinking**?”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8) Submission

Upload to Canvas:

1.  Your completed **Excel workbook (.xlsx)**\
2.  A document (Word/PDF or Canvas text entry) with your responses, including the AI reflection

Please bring your `.xlsx` file to class for in‑class demonstrations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Alignment to Course Outcomes

-   **Choose the right analysis:** You identify grain, tidy structure, and variable types to determine valid analyses.\
-   **Interpret results in context:** Your pivot and explanations tie summaries to what the data can and cannot answer.\
-   **Explain limitations, assumptions, and uncertainty:** Your AI reflection and grain discussion surface constraints *before* statistics.
