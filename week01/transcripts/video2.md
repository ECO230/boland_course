So once you have an idea of what data is in our dataset, how it's tract, it's good to take a look at those variables and think, Okay, how is this data is actually stored? Either How was it coded? How is it stored numerically? Is that gonna be useful for us? Is it going to be, is it going to tell us the information that we need? Or do we need to go look at data from a different source?

So textbook definition of how data is measured is as follows. As follows. Here, we talked a little bit about those categorical variables. There's numeric variables. But this type of data and how it's stored. It is also important to know what's the scale that the date is on. So textbook definition, we have nominal ordinal, interval and ratio scale data. And this is getting into, once we have this data, numerically, what we do with it mathematically.

Nominal scale is the lowest level. This is a naming type verbal, so the categories that we have are just there for naming purposes just to keep track of. Okay. This person isn't, this, isn't this category or not. It's usually a categorical type scale.

Ordinal scale is the same sort of thing. We looked at this a little bit with categorical scales where there's some order inherent to the, to the way the data is tracked.
