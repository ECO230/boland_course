So we've talked a little bit about how to get the data that we need into our hands onto your computer to do our analysis. Once we have our data ready to go, It's always good to open up that dataset, take a look at it and get a sense of what is this data actually going to be telling us? How is the houses data stored? Is it in a format that's gonna be, it's gonna be useful for analysis. Or do we need to do some additional work in that transform space where we're getting that data set up and organized just how we want it.
