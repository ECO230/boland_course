## Format

This is a face-to-face course. You may be asked to reference materials or participate online through the learning management system, Canvas. If that is the case, you will need your UWL NetID to login to the course from the Canvas homepage <http://www.uwlax.edu/canvas>.

## Grading

### Calculations

Your overall grade consists of the following assessments, arranged by type and value. Your final grade can be computed by multiplying the scores received by the percentages reported below to arrive at a weighted average. Team assignments are denoted by (T) but please note grades received for team project deliverables will be adjusted by your Peer Evaluation score.

`r kbl_syllabus(ap)`

### Calculation of individual grades for team project work

All work for the assignments denoted as Team Projects by (T) above will be scored out of 100 points to assign a Team Grade. Individual grades will be computed by multiplying the Team Grade by the CATME peer evaluation score you receive for that work. The CATME peer evaluation is a psychometrically validated and behaviorally anchored rating scale developed under a National Science Foundation Grant and used by universities throughout the country. Through a secure web-based platform, you will rate your own and your teammate’s performance on each project. This information will be reported in the aggregate to your teammates (they cannot see who gave them what scores) and will produce a Peer Evaluation Score. Most students receive a score of 1, those that exhibit exceptional performance receive scores above 1 with a maximum of 1.05. Underperforming teammates receive scores below 1, and as low as 0.4.

::: callout-note
**Note:** This is not a “zero sum game”. It is possible for team members to get scores above 1 without others getting scores below. The algorithm flags evaluations that appear to manipulate ratings to inflate their own scores. Your score will automatically be reduced by 0.05 if you fail to complete the Peer Evaluation on or before the due date.
:::

### Grievance procedure for peer evaluation scores

Poor peer evaluations can lead an individual grade to fall substantially below the Team Grade. For example, a project that received a score of 95/100 would produce an individual grade of 38/100 if you receive a peer evaluation score of 0.4. If you feel the score you received does not accurately reflect your contributions to Team Project work, you have the option to file a grievance. To do so you must follow this procedure:

1.  Within 2 business days of the official notification that grades have been posted, communicate to your instructor via email your intent to file a grievance. Official notifications of grade posting will appear on Canvas notifications.
2.  Within 1 business day of notifying your intent, prepare and email a one page formal letter addressed to your teammates and including the following information:
    -   **Your understanding of the work you had agreed to do** for the deliverable. Be sure to refer to any documentation that is relevant (Meeting Minutes, emails or group chats, revision histories in documents etc.). Be prepared to provide any documentation you mention in the letter if requested.
    -   **A summary of the work you actually did.** Refer to documentation as above.
    -   **Justification for any discrepancies between (a) and (b).** If this documentation includes any confidential health or personal matters you do not wish to disclose to your team, please raise this with me or contact Student Life Office for council. Note: In these cases it is best to reach out to me or Student Life before you are at the point of receiving a bad peer evaluation.
    -   **A statement of the peer evaluation score you believe you have earned.**
3.  If after reviewing your letter I believe the case has merit, I will send it on to your teammates and schedule an arbitration. If I determine no arbitration is warranted, I will schedule a one-on-one meeting with you to discuss.
4.  If arbitration is warranted, it must be conducted in-person with all team members present. The only exception to this requirement would be a case where the timeline in the procedure would place the earliest possible arbitration date after the final exam date. In those cases, a virtual meeting may be agreed upon or incomplete grades may be assigned until an in-person meeting can be scheduled. I will serve as the arbitrator. You and your teammates will have the opportunity to present your case and reconcile evidence referenced in your letter. At the end of the meeting, all team members (including yourself) will submit the score they believe you have earned to me via secret ballot. I will use this information in making my final determination, but the final determination is mine alone.

### Late assignments, missed quizzes

#### Individual assignments

::: callout-warning
Individual assignments are due on the dates indicated on the Canvas Weekly Agendas. Late or missing assignments will not be graded. **All assignments in a module must be completed before the Module Quiz.** If extenuating circumstances impact your ability to meet deadlines or participate in class activities, you are responsible for alerting me as soon as possible. When conflicts are known ahead of the deadline you must notify me ahead of the deadline. All communication regarding missed or late individual work should be confirmed by email – even if we speak in person or during student hours, you must follow up via email to confirm so that we both have a record of the agreement.
:::

#### Team assignments

Deadlines for Team Assignments may be extended for the entire class if there are extenuating circumstances or granted to teams if requested with appropriate justification and all team members agree to the request. **Presentations cannot be delayed unless there is a major emergency or complication.** For other deliverables, extensions must be requested at least 1 business day before the due date. Be prepared to show appropriate documentation of work to date and to provide an explanation for the value you will add to the final product if the extension is granted. Unless a request is made and granted, late assignments will receive a grade of 0.

#### Missed quizzes

Quizzes may be rescheduled only in the case of serious illness, injury, or significant academic or professional development opportunity. Personal travel or family vacations will not be accommodated unless they are associated with a significant life event (birth, death, marriage, graduation). In all cases, documentation is required. Contact me via email as soon as you know you have a conflict. Local or phone/Skype job interviews are not considered significant professional development opportunities.

### Attendance and participation

Although attendance will not be formally recorded for all class meetings, your Team can and should reduce your peer evaluation score if you miss meetings or are absent during in class Work Days. To avoid this consequence, you should:

-   Communicate clearly with your team any time you will be absent from a Team Meeting or class on a day that includes Case Work Time.\
-   Document that communication (e.g. save emails or post to team message board).\
-   Participate actively in scheduling Team Meetings outside of class.\
-   Lay out policies on scheduling team meetings and missed meetings and follow them.\
-   Respect others’ time and reserve absences for only when absolutely unavoidable.\
-   Communicate with me (your instructor) or the Office of Student Life if any situation arises that will dramatically impact your attendance in class and at team meetings (e.g. serious illness, injury or personal emergency).

If you are absent from class, it is your responsibility to obtain notes and other materials from colleagues. While you are welcome to book student hours, you should not view them as a substitute for coming to class. If you are absent regularly without a documented extenuating circumstance, requests for student hours meetings may be denied.

### Expectations for graded work

#### Individual assignments

I provide students feedback and/or scores on assignments that require individualized grading before a further assignment of a similar format is due or within 21 days of submission, whichever is shorter. This includes quizzes. I will notify you if I am unable to complete grading within the 21-day timeframe, and will identify a revised return date. If you submit work after the due date, it may not be returned within 21 days, and depending on the justification for late submission, it may not be accepted at all. Your graded coursework will be returned in compliance with FERPA regulations, such as in class, during my student hours, or via the course management system through which only you will have access to your grades.
